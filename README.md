Simple Voting System (Solidity Learning Project)
This repository contains a Decentralized Voting Smart Contract built with Solidity. This is my very first project as I begin my journey into Web3 development and smart contract programming.

The goal of this project is to understand the core fundamentals of Ethereum development, specifically how to manage state, handle user inputs, and implement basic security rules on the blockchain.

🚀 Key Features
Candidate Management: Allows an admin to add candidates to the ballot.

One-Person-One-Vote: Implements a mapping system to ensure that a wallet address can only cast a vote once.

Transparent Counting: Vote counts are stored on-chain and can be verified by anyone.

Access Control: Uses basic logic to distinguish between the contract owner and regular voters.
